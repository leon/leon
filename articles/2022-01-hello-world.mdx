# Well, better late than never

I don't know why it seems to be so hard to create a new homepage for myself.

Since it's my day job to create stuff I guess I'm to hard on myself and never feel that the page I create is good enough.

But as a new years resolution for 2022, I was determined to create a new page where I could share things with the world.

It has taken longer than I thought to get everything working as I want to.

I first wrote it in next.js, but then when [Remix](https://remix.run) got released, I found it so much easier to work with so I had to rewrite everything.

It might not be 100% complete, but I really need to get something out there, so you will have to bear with me until I've polished some things.

Here's hoping for a more productive 2022.
