import { Center } from './center'

Both flexbox and grid have ways of centering items, so below I will show you both ways.

## Using Flexbox

```css
.center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* horizontally */
  align-items: center; /* vertically */
}
```

## Using grid

```css
.center {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

<Center />
