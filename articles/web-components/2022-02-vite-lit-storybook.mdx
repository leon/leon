At work we wanted to build some simple web components to publish to NPM.
I didn't want to go overboard with the tooling, so I decided to use Vite.
I was thinking about writing plain web components, but there is a lot of boiler plate, therefor I chose [Lit](https://lib.dev) for the job.

### Setup new Vite project

We start by setting up a new Vite project.

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-webcomponents -- --template lit-ts
```

### Install Storybook

Storybook is built on top of Webpack, but in version 7 they are working against allowing you to use esbuild or vite or swc or whatever floats your boat.
They have started to work against this goal and we can install `storybook-builder-vite` so that the stories are built with Vite.
I think they still use webpack for building the UI, but our stories will at least be faster built using Vite.

```bash
npx sb@latest init --builder storybook-builder-vite
```

### Vite config changes

In our case we wanted to be able to use the web components without having to bundle lit with it, so we need to change so Vite doesn't externalize `lit`
We do this by

```ts
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    lib: {
      entry: 'src/my-element.ts',
      formats: ['es'],
    },
    rollupOptions: {
      // If we want to publish standalone components we don't externalize lit,
      // if you are going to use lit in your own project, you can make it a dep instead.
      // external: /^lit/,
    },
  },
})
```

### Typescript config changes

Because we have added storybook we need to exclude `.stories.ts` files from the typescript compilation, otherwise when we publish to NPM they will be included.

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "esnext",
    "lib": ["es2017", "dom", "dom.iterable"],
    "declaration": true,
    "emitDeclarationOnly": true,
    "outDir": "./types",
    "strict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "useDefineForClassFields": false
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["src/**/*.stories.ts"], // <-- this is the line we need to add
  "references": [{ "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" }]
}
```

### Storybook config changes

The storybook config needs to tweak the vite config for `storybook-builder-vite` to work.
We need to include and exclude some packages from the vite config.

```js
// .storybook/main.js
module.exports = {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-links', '@storybook/addon-essentials'],
  framework: '@storybook/web-components',
  core: {
    builder: 'storybook-builder-vite',
  },
  async viteFinal(config, { configType }) {
    // customize the Vite config here
    config.optimizeDeps.include = [...(config.optimizeDeps?.include ?? []), '@storybook/web-components']
    config.optimizeDeps.exclude = [...(config.optimizeDeps?.exclude ?? []), 'lit', 'lit-html']

    // return the customized config
    return config
  },
}
```

### Now we have a working Storybook

There is a downside to using web components with storybook, and that is that it does not support hot reload.
so each change will cause Storybook to do a full reload.
Hopefully this will be mitigated in the future.

### Publish to NPM

This section covers the steps needed to publish to NPM.

First off, depending if you want to publish standalone web components you will need to move `lit` to become a devDependency in your `package.json`.

Also instead of only exporting the single `dist/my-element.es.js` file we will change it so we have a barrel file that exports all components.
and change both `index.html` and `vite.config.js` to point `src/index.ts`
We then also need to change `package.json` to export the correct files.
And we also want to make the package public by removing `"private": true` and choosing a name and license.

after this we should be good to go by running

```bash
npm run build
```

then checking `/dist/` to see that the correct files are there, and that our `package.json` points to these files.

then we can run

```bash
npm publish
```

If all has gone well you should be able to use your new package by importing it

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.skypack.dev/my-element"></script>
<my-element name="Lit"></my-element>
```
