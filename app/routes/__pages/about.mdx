I'm born and raised in Örebro, Sweden in the eighties.
It all started when my mom went to art collage in Brighton, England. Fell in love with my eccentric dad who was working as the ceramics teacher.
One thing led to another which led to them moving to Örebro to have me.

## How it all began

I hav always been interested in technology and got my first computer a Pentium 75 at the age of 12.

At first it was a lot to learn, back then there was no internet and I spent a lot of time playing [Doom](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)>), [Quake](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)>), [heretic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heretic_(video_game)>).

As soon as I got my first 56-kbit modem I was fascinated by the internet and spent a lot of time downloading mp3, burning cds for parties, and wanting to know how everything worked.

I learned [Adobe Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) and got into [Adobe Dreamweaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver).

Somewhere along the way I figured out I was quite good at computers, always helping friends and family.

I might be on to something here...

## School

I first went to a collage which was aimed at welding, cnc, pneumatics.

But after a year I dropped out and switched to a collage focusing on media, graphic design, photo, music.

## Work

My first job was as an apprentice at a local print / photo studio.
I worked with digital photography, Photoshop and layout.

I then worked as the IT-guy at a telecom firm.

Here I became a certified network technician, learned c#, programmed a bunch of internal tools and worked with creating ads for the newspaper.
In the night time I was hacking on javascript and getting into MooTools.

The I started a firm together a couple of friends to work as consultants.

After a couple of years, I needed more stability because I was starting a family, so i started as a web developer at a local firm.

Here I worked with creating homepages / intranets in Wordpress, EpiServer, JQuery / MooTools.
To later on create e-commerce and analytics apps using Spring Boot, Angular, MongoDB.
After 8 years doing this, I felt it was time for a change.

I got the possibility to work at [wec360°](https://www.wec360.com) building a real estate visualization platform.

I worked my way up the ranks and I'm now the CTO.

It's hard to fathom that I've been in the industry for over 20 years.
It feels like I still have a lot to learn, but I guess that is never going to change.

## Family

My mom and dad both live here in Örebro.

I have a sister and brother where I am the oldest.

I live with my lovely girlfriend Li and our two daughters, Tyra and Juni.
We live in the countryside outside of Örebro in a [falu red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falu_red) house with white trims.

## Hobbies

I have a lot of hobbies, and try to fit them in as much as possible.

- Disc Golf
- Mountain biking
- Beer brewing
- Motorcycles
